            <h2>ACADEMIC REGULATIONS</h2>
            <p id="gpa-maintenance"><strong>GPA Maintenance Requirement.</strong> The academic progress of students is monitored at the end of each term. To continue in the program, students must remain in good academic standing, which is to maintain an assessment grade point average (AGPA) of at least 3.00 on a minimum of 12 credits. Students whose AGPA falls below 3.00 are considered to be on academic probation. Students whose AGPA falls below 3.00 for any two review periods are considered to be in failed standing.</p>
            <p id="c-rule"><strong>C Rule.</strong> Graduate students who receive a grade of C for any course during their studies will be required to attend a review meeting with the Graduate Program Director. The decision as to whether or not the student will continue in the program, rests with the Program Director. After the aforementioned meeting, if a continuation is granted, a request will be made to the School of Graduate Studies. Students who receive more than one grade of C for multiple courses during their studies will be withdrawn from the program. Students who have been withdrawn may request readmission. If readmitted, if another grade of C is obtained after readmission, the student will be withdrawn from the program, and will not be considered for readmission again.</p>
            <p id="f-rule"><strong>F Rule.</strong> Students who receive a failing grade in any course during their studies will be withdrawn from the program, unless a continuation in the program is requested by the Program Director and approved by the Dean of Graduate Studies. If withdrawn, students may apply for readmission. Students who receive another failing grade after readmission will be withdrawn from the program and will not be reconsidered for readmission again.</p>
            <p id="duration"><strong>Duration of Programs.</strong> It is expected that full-time students will complete the requirements for most master's/magisteriate degree programs within 6 terms (2 years). The expected time to completion for a doctoral degree for full-time students is 12 terms (4 years).</p>
            <p id="time-limit"><strong>Time Limit.</strong> Program time limits indicate the maximum program duration specified by the university. The time limit for a master's/magisteriate degree for full-time students is 9 terms (3 years), and for part-time students is 15 terms (5 years). The time limit for a doctoral degree is 18 terms (6 years) of full-time study or 24 terms (8 years) of part-time study. A change of status once you have begun your degree does not equate to additional terms within your time limit. The number of remaining terms will be calculated by the Office of the Registrar and pro-rated. Every effort should be made to complete a thesis within the time limit provided. In exceptional circumstances a time limit extension may be requested, and upon recommendation of the GPD and approval of the School of Graduate Studies, short extensions may be permitted. Graduation Requirement. In order to graduate, students must have a cumulative GPA of at least 3.00.</p>
            <p id="gen-ai"><strong>Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI).</strong> As pointed out by Concordia’s Centre for Teaching and Learning (CTL), within the complex landscape of GenAI integration in higher education, it is essential to find a balance between “the pedagogical benefits and ethical challenges” of GenAI capabilities (e.g. ChatGPT). To help find this balance, the CTL proposes a framework and some guidelines. Graduate students and supervisors are encouraged to read this document and to CLEARLY DEFINE what is permitted - or not - in terms of the use of GenAI, before commencing each major requirement of the graduate program. Students who want to use GenAI for certain aspects of their research, should first discuss this possibility with their supervisor and the committee members. If the student, the supervisor and the committee members agree on the relevance of the use of GenAI for the student’s research, they need to clearly define the extent and the limits of this use. This agreement could range from a simple sentence to a much more detailed document for a project in which GenAI might play a more central role. This agreement and a detailed description of how GenAI has been used throughout the research should appear clearly in the final thesis. For more information about how to use GenAI in higher education and at Concordia please refer to the framework and guidelines produced by the CTL.</p>

            <h2>ADMISSION REQUIREMENTS</h2>
            <h3 id="msc-admission">M.SC.</h3>
            <p>The normal requirements for admission into the M.Sc. are a minimum GPA of 3.30/4.33 (“B+” average or better) in a B.A. or B.Sc. program in Geography, Urban Planning, Environmental Science, or a related field of study from a recognized university. Applicants are selected on the basis of a sound undergraduate academic record, strong letters of recommendation, and a convincing statement of purpose which clearly describes their academic interest in the program and intended area of research. In addition, admission is contingent on the availability of an appropriate faculty member from within the GPE Department to serve as research supervisor. Some applicants with deficiencies in their undergraduate preparation may be required to take a qualifying program. Others may be required to complete certain prerequisite courses in addition to the regular graduate program.</p>
            <h3 id="phd-admission">PH.D.</h3>
            <p>The normal requirement for admission into the Ph.D. is a M.A. or M.Sc. in Geography, Urban Planning, Environmental Science, or a related field of study from a recognized university. Applicants are selected on the basis of a sound academic record, strong letters of recommendation, and a convincing statement of purpose which clearly describes their academic interest in the program and intended area of research. In addition, admission is contingent on the availability of an appropriate faculty member from within the GPE Department to serve as research supervisor. It is also possible for students currently registered in our Department’s M.Sc. program to apply for permission to fast-track directly to doctoral studies. This fast-track option is reserved for exceptional students who have demonstrated outstanding research potential during the first year of their M.Sc. program, and requires the recommendation of their supervisor and other faculty members from within the Department of Geography, Planning and Environment.</p>
            <h3 id="lang-prof">Language Proficiency Requirements for all Degrees</h3>
            <p>The language of instruction at Concordia is English. Any student, whose first language is other than English, must demonstrate proficiency in English. Several proficiency tests are accepted. Additional information on accepted tests and their scores can be found here: http://www.concordia.ca/admissions/graduate/requirements/english-language-proficiency.html</p>

        <section id="comprehensive">
            <h2>COMPREHENSIVE EXAMINATION AND THESIS PROPOSAL</h2>
            <p>The comprehensive exam is normally completed in the fall term of the 2nd year of the program and must be completed within 2 years from entry into the doctoral program. It consists of one or two questions related to the thesis field, and another one or two questions for each of two cognate fields. Cognate fields are areas of knowledge that aid the student to situate their research within a broader context.</p>
            <p>The comprehensive examination consists of a written and oral component. To begin, the student and supervisor define fields and compile a reading list of 60-80 articles. The exam should be scheduled within three months of confirming the list. Each committee member sends questions to the supervisor, who assembles a total of 3 or 6 questions. The use of GenAI (e.g. ChatGPT) is NOT ALLOWED for the comprehensive exam. Any use during a comprehensive examination will be considered as an academic offense.</p>
            <h3 id="model-1">Model 1: The Three-Essay Model</h3>
            <p>The student responds to 6 questions (2 per field) and selects one question from each set on which they will prepare an essay (~3000 words each). Students generally have 3 days (72 hours) to complete each essay (9 days in total).</p>
            <h3 id="model-2">Model 2: The Review Article Model</h3>
            <p>The student receives 3 questions and selects one to submit a review article of approximately 7500 words within four weeks. The review article should be of sufficient quality and scope that it shows potential for publication.</p>
            <h3 id="thesis-proposal-henv810">Thesis Proposal (HENV 810)</h3>
            <p>A detailed thesis proposal (7500 words) should normally be submitted to the thesis committee within the first 20 months of the student’s program. The committee evaluates the written proposal and holds a meeting with a 15-minute presentation. In some cases, students may write their thesis proposal in advance and defend it at the same time as the comprehensive examination.</p>

            <p>The M.Sc. and Ph.D. programs are designed to provide students with the theoretical foundations and methodological tools necessary to contribute to the understanding of human and environmental systems. Through an emphasis on both specialization and interdisciplinary perspectives, students are given the opportunity to carry out in-depth research work in any of the Department’s areas of specialization covering three broad categories of environment: the natural or biophysical environment; the human, cultural or behavioural environment; and the urban, built or designed environment. In addition to contributing to the advancement of knowledge, students will be well placed to enter a wide range of careers in environmental, urban planning and public policy fields.</p>

The committee is comprised of three members: the supervisor, and two other members who can contribute to the appropriate training of the student in the field of study. If there is a co-supervisor, the committee will have four members (two supervisors and two other members). Normally, not more than one thesis committee member should be from another department and/or university. A member from outside the university would normally hold a Ph.D. degree.</p>
            <p>The role of the thesis committee is to evaluate the thesis proposal (HENV 685). This is a Pass/Fail course. The student must submit a written thesis proposal (a sound rationale for the proposed research, a detailed description of the research design and methodology, and a comprehensive literature review) which will be evaluated by all members of the thesis committee. After the written part of the proposal has been accepted by the committee, the student will present orally their proposal to the committee. The committee also evaluates the final thesis and the oral defence.</p>
